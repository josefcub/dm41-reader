# SwissMicros DM41 Memory Dump Reader

Demystifies and prints memory contents from the SwissMicro's DM41 calculator's text dumps.

dm41.pl is written in Perl.  Please ensure that you have the correct Perl modules installed via CPAN before running.  Included are several memory dumps:

blank41.txt - A completely blank memory profile
dm41.txt - My personal DM41 memory loadout, with many programs entered
noalarms.txt - A version with no alarms for testing

# WARNING

Always back up your memory dumps before using this tool.  Additionally, compiling programs in from the command line is undocumented and BROKEN.  Do not use.
